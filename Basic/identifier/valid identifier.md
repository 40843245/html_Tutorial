# Valid Identifier

The requirements must be both satisfied.

1) NOT same as keyword (or preserved word).
2) Only consist of alphabetic letter, digit and underscores (i.e. '_'), dollar symbol (i.e. '$')
3) Can NOT start with digits. 
(It is true for js, but in most programming language, it can be start with alphabetic letter and letetr. There are slightly difference between different languages.)
4) The length of identifier must NOT over than the maximum length. (P.S. I am NOT sure the maximum length of identifier in js.)
